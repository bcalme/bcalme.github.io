I am currently a Research Fellow in Soft Magnetic Surgical Robots at the University of Leeds. My research interests include medical robotics, soft robotics and mechanical design. My previous work includes the development of a modular snake-like robot for minimally invasive surgery, the optimisation of compliant mechanisms and the development of 3D printable actuators and their incorporation into mechatronic systems.
