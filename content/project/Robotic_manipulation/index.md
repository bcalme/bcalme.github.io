This teaching unit covers the techniques and tools necessary for kinematic and dynamic modelling and control for robotic manipulation. The classes are structured around the following four axes: 
1) Modeling of manipulator robots: homogeneous transformations, direct and inverse geometric models, kinematic modeling, study of singularities. 
2) Introduction to the dynamics of robotic manipulators: Euler-Lagrange formalism, Newton-Euler formalism, algorithms for the calculation of dynamics. 
3) Joint and operational control in free space. 
4) Motion control in constrained space: interaction models and compliance, position/force control, impedance and admittance control, motion generation, application examples. The application of these various points is made on a UR10 robot.
