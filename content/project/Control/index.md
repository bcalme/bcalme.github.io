title: Dynamic Systems and Control
summary: This tutorial addresses dynamic systems, i.e. systems that evolve over time. These systems have inputs and outputs and it is of interest to understand how the input affects the output (or vice versa). The design (control) of systems that guarantee the desirable properties (e.g. stability, performance) of the interconnection with a given dynamic system is also addressed..
