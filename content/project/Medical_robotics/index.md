This teaching unit covers the techniques and tools necessary for kinematic and dynamic modelling and control of robots for medical applications, with a focus on surgery and interventional radiology. The classes are structured around the following four axes: 
1) Geometric and kinematic modelling of various medical robots (parallel rigid, cable, concentric tube, flexible, etc.). 
2) Needle/tissue interaction modelling. 
3) Technical/technological challenges of design and perception in medical robotics. 
4) Hybrid position/effort control and co-manipulation of surgical robots.
