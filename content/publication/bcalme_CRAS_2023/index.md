abstract: During endoscopic procedures, limiting the interactions between the robot and surrounding tissues is an important area of research in order to minimise patient trauma. In the context of the development of a  new robotic architecture, the modelling of contact forces is of interest to validate the dimensioning of the structure's components. The proposed method aims to model the contact forces by identifying the  external moments applied to the robot and by comparing the induced internal moments with respect to a known admissible moment. This approach also allows to consider the use of tissues, in a controlled way,  as a support in order to choose an optimal configuration of the robot allowing to reduce the internal stress of the structure. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.
